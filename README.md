# TicTacToe
Simple TicTacToe game on console. The whole purpose of this project was for me to get familiar with some of the basic
functionalities Python provides and to recognize the paradigm for this language. This project is, by no means, up to
professional level, so some comments might not be office appropiate.

# Up next:
- I will be adding AI to this project in the near future; probably when I'm done working on my next project which will
also target familiarity with language features and APIs, Frameworks, and/or libraries.
